# portofolio
A beginners journey

Greetings,

Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Onisim B. and I am currently studying software engineering, while also pursuing other courses to improve my coding knowledge. I am always curious to explore new programming languages and excited to join other opportunities for learning and building upon my current knowledge and experience as a junior developer (or I could say a neophyte).

Currently, I am concentrating on Java and Python, but I am aiming to become a full-stack developer in the future. On this repository, you will find some codes that I have been working on alone or in collaboration with other fellow programmers. I am constantly updating and improving my projects, so feel free to explore and provide any feedback you might have.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope my work can be of use to you!

Best regards!
